### About the Playground
I have built this playground to give a gamified self introduction.
### Pro Tip
Not able to throw on target? Swipe straight a little(not too less and not too more).
### Attentionâš 
The preferable orientation to run the code will be having a portait liveview. Below are the examples for it!
